### Decisions

#### RFC (Request for Comments)

Used to propose and evaluate technical change options. RFCs may explore multiple solutions and reference other RFCs, ADRs, guides, or rules. Store in docs/decisions/rfc/. Even rejected RFCs are useful to keep.

#### ADR (Architectural Decision Record)

Captures key architectural decisions and their rationale. May result from an RFC or be created independently. Store in docs/decisions/adr/. Keep both accepted and rejected ADRs.
